// Plain wrapper around Node's own global fetch, forced to HTTP/1.1 --
// but *only* outside Vercel (see the `isVercel` check below).
//
// NOT a singleton -- this Agent is constructed fresh on every call and
// never stored on globalThis or at module scope, specifically to avoid the
// earlier Fast-Refresh/pooled-connection lifecycle bug. Its only purpose
// is `allowH2: false`.
//
// Why: the logs showed one request hit a corrupted TLS connection ("bad
// record mac" -- almost certainly TLS-inspecting AV/VPN software mangling
// records, not something fixable from application code), and the
// *retry* immediately failed too, with `ERR_HTTP2_INVALID_SESSION` /
// "session has been destroyed". That's HTTP/2 connection multiplexing
// working against us: undici was reusing the same pooled HTTP/2
// connection for the retry, so a single corrupted connection took every
// request on it down with it, retries included. Forcing HTTP/1.1 means a
// retry opens a genuinely new connection instead of reusing a poisoned
// one, so `getUserWithRetry`'s existing retry can actually succeed rather
// than being doomed by construction. Logs and rethrows unchanged --
// behavior (including existing retry logic) is otherwise unaffected.
//
// Vercel gate: that TLS corruption was local-machine AV/VPN interference,
// never observed in production. The standalone `undici` npm package this
// Agent comes from doesn't match the internal undici version Vercel's
// Next.js runtime patches `fetch` through -- passing this dispatcher
// there breaks the internal request-handler contract with
// `UND_ERR_INVALID_ARG: invalid onRequestStart method`, which took down
// *every* Supabase call (auth, REST) in production. Vercel sets
// `process.env.VERCEL` in every one of its own environments (prod,
// preview, `vercel dev`), so this restores the fix exactly where it's
// needed (a developer's own machine) without it ever reaching Vercel's
// runtime again.
